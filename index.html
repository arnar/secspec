              <h2>Computer Security</h2>
              <p>
                The Computer Security course provides basic knowledge in the security area, i.e. how to
protect your system against intentional intrusions and attacks. The
purpose of intrusions can be made to change or delete resources (data,
programs, hardware, etc), to get unauthorized access to confidential
information or unauthorized use of the system's services. The course
covers threats and vulnerabilities in the computer systems and networks,
as well as rules, methods and mechanisms for protection. Modeling and
assessment of security and dependability as well as metrication methods
are covered. During a few lectures, a holistic security approach is
taken and organizational, business-related, social, human, legal and
ethical aspects are treated.

              <h2>Cryptography</h2>
              <p>
                The course covers cryptographic primitives such as private-key and public-key ciphers, hash functions, MAC's and signatures and how to embed these in cryptographic protocols to achieve basic goals such as confidentiality, authentication and non-repudiation, but also more elaborate services, such as key management, digital cash and electronic voting. Many examples of broken protocols are also discussed to enhance understanding of the engineering difficulties in building secure systems.

              <h2>Language-based Security</h2>
              <p>
                 The course covers the principles of programming
language-based techniques for computer security. The goal is
understanding such application-level attacks as races, buffer
overruns, covert channels, and code injection as well as mastering the
principles behind such language-based protection techniques as static
analysis, program transformation, and reference monitoring. The dual
perspective of attack vs. protection is threaded through the lectures,
laboratory assignments, and projects.

              <h2>Network security</h2>
              <p>
                Why is it possible to break into networked applications and computer
systems? What weaknesses are used? And what makes one protocol more
secure than another? This course answers these questions and many more.
We look at weaknesses that have plagued wired and wireless networked
systems for years. We then continue with countermeasures like firewalls
and security protocols such as SSL, SSH and IPsec and investigate in
detail what makes them secure. Knowledge about possible threats and
countermeasures is important not only for the network security
specialist but also for application programmers and everyone else who
wants to understand what level of security a system and an application
can offer. By knowing the problems, future systems can be designed to be
much more secure and reliable than today.

          Security is becoming increasingly important for system design and
          development. System architects and designers must have security
          expertise, so that the systems they design do not fall victims to
          attacks. Software developers and engineers must have security
          expertise, so that the code they produce cannot be exploited. Security
          and network specialists must have critical knowledge of security
          principles and practice, in order to ensure the security of the systems
          they are responsible for.
